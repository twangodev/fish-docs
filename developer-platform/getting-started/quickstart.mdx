## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

## Your First TTS Request

The simplest way to generate speech is with a cURL command:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your API key">
    Store your API key as an environment variable for security:
    
    ```bash
    export FISH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make the TTS request">
    Run this [cURL](https://curl.se/) command to generate your first speech:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $FISH_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "model: s1" \
      -d '{
        "text": "Hello! Welcome to Fish Audio. \
This is my first AI-generated voice.",
        "format": "mp3"
      }' \
      --output welcome.mp3
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Play your audio">
    The audio has been saved as `welcome.mp3`. You can play it with:
    
    ```bash
    # Simply open it in your media player, or use command line:
    
    # On macOS
    afplay welcome.mp3
    
    # On Linux
    mpg123 welcome.mp3
    
    # On Windows (This opens your default media player)
    start welcome.mp3
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
