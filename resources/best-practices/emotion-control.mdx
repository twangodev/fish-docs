## Overview

Control how your AI voice expresses emotions, from happy and excited to sad and contemplative. Add natural pauses, laughter, and other human-like elements to make speech more engaging.

## Basic Emotions

### How to Use

Simply wrap emotion tags in parentheses before your text:

```
(happy) What a beautiful day!
(sad) I'm sorry to hear that.
(excited) This is amazing news!
```

### Available Emotions

**Common Emotions:**
- `(happy)` - Cheerful, upbeat tone
- `(sad)` - Melancholic, downcast voice
- `(angry)` - Frustrated, aggressive tone
- `(excited)` - Energetic, enthusiastic
- `(calm)` - Peaceful, relaxed
- `(nervous)` - Anxious, uncertain
- `(confident)` - Assertive, self-assured
- `(surprised)` - Shocked, amazed

**Complex Emotions:**
- `(empathetic)` - Understanding, caring
- `(sarcastic)` - Ironic, mocking
- `(grateful)` - Thankful, appreciative
- `(curious)` - Inquisitive, interested
- `(frustrated)` - Annoyed, exasperated
- `(proud)` - Accomplished, satisfied

## Tone Control

### Volume & Intensity

Control how loud or soft the voice speaks:

```
(shouting) Hey, over here!
(whispering) This is a secret...
(soft tone) Good night, sweet dreams.
```

### Speech Patterns

Add urgency or emphasis:

```
(in a hurry tone) We need to leave now!
(screaming) Watch out!
```

## Natural Speech Elements

### Laughter & Sounds

Make speech more human with natural sounds:

```
That's hilarious! (laughing) Ha, ha, ha!
I can't believe it... (sighing) sigh.
This is exhausting (panting) huff, huff.
```

**Available Sounds:**
- `(laughing)` - Full laughter
- `(chuckling)` - Light laugh
- `(sighing)` - Exasperation or relief
- `(sobbing)` - Crying
- `(groaning)` - Frustration
- `(panting)` - Out of breath

### Pauses & Breaks

Add natural pauses to your speech:

```
Let me think... (break) Yes, that's it!
I need to tell you something (long-break) it's important.
```

## Combining Effects

### Layered Emotions

Combine multiple tags for complex expressions:

```
(sad)(soft tone) I miss you so much.
(angry)(shouting) Get out of here now!
(excited)(laughing) We won! Ha ha!
```

### Scene Examples

**Customer Service:**
```
(friendly) Hello! How can I help you today?
(empathetic) I understand your frustration.
(confident) I'll resolve this for you right away.
```

**Storytelling:**
```
(mysterious)(whispering) Once upon a midnight dreary...
(excited) Suddenly, the door burst open!
(scared)(shouting) Run for your lives!
```

**Educational Content:**
```
(enthusiastic) Welcome to today's lesson!
(curious) Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue?
(proud) Great job! You got it right!
```

## Important Rules

### Placement Matters

**For English:**
- Emotion tags MUST go at the beginning of sentences
- Tone controls can go anywhere
- Sound effects can go anywhere

**Correct:**
```
(happy) What a wonderful day!
```

**Incorrect:**
```
What a (happy) wonderful day!
```

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use one emotion per sentence
- Add sounds after relevant words
- Keep tags simple and clear
- Test different combinations

**Don't:**
- Overuse tags in short text
- Mix conflicting emotions
- Create custom tags
- Forget the parentheses

## Real-World Examples

### Virtual Assistant

```
(friendly) Good morning! 
(helpful) I've prepared your schedule for today.
(concerned) You have three urgent emails.
(encouraging) Let's tackle them together!
```

### Audiobook Narration

```
(narrator) Chapter One: The Beginning
(mysterious) The old house stood silent in the fog.
(scared)(whispering) "Is anyone there?" she asked.
(relieved)(sighing) No one answered. Phew.
```

### Game Character

```
(brave) I'll defeat the dragon!
(struggling)(panting) This is... harder than... I thought!
(triumphant)(shouting) Victory is mine!
(laughing) Ha ha ha!
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Emotion Transitions

Gradually change emotions:

```
(happy) I got the promotion!
(uncertain) But... it means moving away.
(sad) I'll miss everyone here.
```

### Background Effects

Add atmosphere:

```
The comedy show was amazing (audience laughing)
Everyone at the party was having fun (background laughter)
The crowd loved it (crowd laughing)
```

### Subtle Variations

Fine-tune emotional intensity:

- Use `(slightly sad)` for mild sadness
- Use `(very excited)` for extreme excitement
- Combine with tone: `(happy)(soft tone)` for gentle happiness

## Troubleshooting

3. Don't use quotes around tags
4. Include parentheses

### Unnatural Sound?
