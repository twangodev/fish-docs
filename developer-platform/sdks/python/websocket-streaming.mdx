<Note>
This documentation is coming soon. We're preparing guides for:
- WebSocketSession setup and configuration
- Real-time text streaming
- Event handling (StartEvent, TextEvent, CloseEvent)
- Synchronous WebSocket usage
- AsyncWebSocketSession for async applications
- Dynamic text generation
- Error handling in WebSocket connections
- Performance optimization for streaming
</Note>

Check our [Quick Start guide](/developer-platform/sdks/python/quickstart#websocket-streaming) for a basic WebSocket example.
