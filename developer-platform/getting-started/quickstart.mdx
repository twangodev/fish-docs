## Overview

This guide will walk you through generating your first text-to-speech audio with Fish Audio. By the end, you'll have converted text into natural-sounding speech using our API.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

## Your First TTS Request

Choose your preferred method to generate speech:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set your API key">
        Store your API key as an environment variable (recommended approach):

        ```bash
        export FISH_API_KEY="replace_me"
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make the TTS request">
        Run this [cURL](https://curl.se/) command to generate your first speech:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $FISH_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -H "model: s1" \
          -d '{
            "text": "Hello! Welcome to Fish Audio. This is my first AI-generated voice.",
            "format": "mp3"
          }' \
          --output welcome.mp3
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Play your audio">
        The audio has been saved as `welcome.mp3`. You can play it by:

        - Double-clicking the file or opening it in any media player
        - Or using the command line:

        ```bash
        # On macOS
        afplay welcome.mp3

        # On Linux
        mpg123 welcome.mp3

        # On Windows
        start welcome.mp3
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the SDK">
        ```bash
        pip install fish-audio-sdk
        ```

      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate speech">
        Create a Python script:

        ```python
        from fish_audio_sdk import Session, TTSRequest

        # Initialize with your API key
        session = Session("your_api_key_here")

        # Generate speech
        with open("welcome.mp3", "wb") as f:
            for chunk in session.tts(
              TTSRequest(text="Hello! Welcome to Fish Audio."),
              backend='s1'
            ):
                f.write(chunk)

        print("âœ“ Audio saved to welcome.mp3")
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run the script">
        ```bash
        python generate_speech.py
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Play your audio">
        The audio has been saved as `welcome.mp3`. You can play it by:

        - Double-clicking the file or opening it in any media player
        - Or using the command line:

        ```bash
        # On macOS
        afplay welcome.mp3

        # On Linux
        mpg123 welcome.mp3

        # On Windows
        start welcome.mp3
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

## Customizing Your Voice

The examples above use the default voice. To use a different voice, add the `reference_id` parameter with a model ID from [fish.audio](https://fish.audio). You can find the model ID in the URL or use the copy button when viewing any voice.

Choose a voice to try:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="E-Girl Voice">
    From: https://fish.audio/m/8ef4a238714b45718ce04243307c57a7

    ```bash
    export REFERENCE_ID="8ef4a238714b45718ce04243307c57a7"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Energetic Male">
    From: https://fish.audio/m/802e3bc2b27e49c2995d23ef70e6ac89

    ```bash
    export REFERENCE_ID="802e3bc2b27e49c2995d23ef70e6ac89"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then generate speech with your chosen voice:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $FISH_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "model: s1" \
      -d '{
        "text": "This is a custom voice from Fish Audio! You can explore hundreds of different voices on the platform, or even create your own.",
        "reference_id": "'"$REFERENCE_ID"'",
        "format": "mp3"
      }' \
      --output custom_voice.mp3
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    from fish_audio_sdk import Session, TTSRequest

    session = Session("your_api_key_here")

    # Generate speech with custom voice
    with open("custom_voice.mp3", "wb") as f:
        for chunk in session.tts(
          TTSRequest(
            text="This is a custom voice from Fish Audio! You can explore hundreds of different voices on the platform, or even create your own.",
            reference_id=os.environ.get("REFERENCE_ID")
          ),
          backend='s1'
        ):
            f.write(chunk)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
