<Note>
This documentation is coming soon. We're preparing a comprehensive quick start guide including:
- First TTS request example
- Basic authentication setup
- Common use cases and code examples
- Text-to-speech with voice selection
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Listing available voices
- Async/await patterns
- Reference audio usage
- WebSocket streaming basics
- Error handling fundamentals
- Essential imports and parameters
</Note>

For now, here's a minimal example:

```python
from fish_audio_sdk import Session, TTSRequest

session = Session("your_api_key")

with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    for chunk in session.tts(TTSRequest(text="Hello world!")):
        f.write(chunk)
```

See our [Installation guide](/developer-platform/sdks/python/installation) to get started.
