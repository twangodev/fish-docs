### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models

TTS pricing is based on the size of input text, measured in millions of UTF-8 bytes.

|--------------|------------------------|
| `speech-1.5` | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |
| `speech-1.6` | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |
| `s1`         | $15.00 / M UTF-8 bytes |

<Info>
1M UTF-8 bytes is approximately 180,000 English words, or about 12 hours of speech

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Models

| Model Name     | Price (USD)        |
