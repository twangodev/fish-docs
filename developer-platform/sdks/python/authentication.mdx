<Note>
This documentation is coming soon. We're working on comprehensive authentication guides including:
- Getting and managing API keys
- Session initialization and management
- Environment variables and security
- Context managers for automatic cleanup
- Custom endpoints and proxy configuration
- WebSocket authentication
- Security best practices
- Multi-tenant applications
- Authentication error handling
- Testing authentication setup
</Note>

Basic usage:

```python
from fish_audio_sdk import Session

# Initialize with your API key
session = Session("your_api_key")
```

For security, use environment variables:

```python
import os
session = Session(os.getenv("FISH_API_KEY"))
```
