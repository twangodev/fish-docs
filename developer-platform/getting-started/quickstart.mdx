  <Tab title="cURL">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set your API key">
        Store your API key as an environment variable (recommended approach):

        ```bash
        export FISH_API_KEY="replace_me"
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Make the TTS request">
        Run this [cURL](https://curl.se/) command to generate your first speech:

        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $FISH_API_KEY" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -H "model: s1" \
          -d '{
            "text": "Hello! Welcome to Fish Audio. \
This is my first AI-generated voice.",
            "format": "mp3"
          }' \
          --output welcome.mp3
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Play your audio">
        The audio has been saved as `welcome.mp3`. You can play it by:

        - Double-clicking the file or opening it in any media player
        - Or using the command line:

        ```bash
        # On macOS
        afplay welcome.mp3

        # On Linux
        mpg123 welcome.mp3

        # On Windows
        start welcome.mp3
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the SDK">
        ```bash
        pip install fish-audio-sdk
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate speech">
        Create a Python script:

        ```python
        from fish_audio_sdk import Session, TTSRequest

        # Initialize with your API key
        session = Session("your_api_key_here")

        # Generate speech
        with open("welcome.mp3", "wb") as f:
            for chunk in session.tts(TTSRequest(
                text="Hello! Welcome to Fish Audio."
            )):
                f.write(chunk)

        print("âœ“ Audio saved to welcome.mp3")
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run the script">
        ```bash
        python generate_speech.py
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Play your audio">
        The audio has been saved as `welcome.mp3`. You can play it by:

        - Double-clicking the file or opening it in any media player
        - Or using the command line:

        ```bash
        # On macOS
        afplay welcome.mp3

        # On Linux
        mpg123 welcome.mp3

        # On Windows
        start welcome.mp3
        ```
