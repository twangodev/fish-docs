## Getting Started

Voice cloning lets you create a digital version of any voice. You have two options:

- **Quick Clone** (Playground): 30-45 seconds of audio for instant results
- **Premium Clone** (Let's Talk): 30-180 minutes for studio-quality voices with multiple languages and emotions

## Recording Your Voice

### Find a Quiet Space

**Good places to record:**
- A bedroom with curtains and carpet
- Inside a parked car
- A quiet office or study room
- Any room with soft furniture

**Avoid recording near:**
- Open windows with traffic noise
- Running appliances (AC, fans, refrigerators)
- Other people talking
- TVs or music playing

### Use What You Have

**Best options:**
- USB microphone or gaming headset
- Phone voice recorder app (place it on a stable surface)
- Earbuds with microphone (hold them steady)

**Quick tip:** Keep the microphone about a hand's width from your mouth and speak normally.

## What to Say

### For Quick Clone (30-45 seconds)

**Best approach:** Record 2-3 clips of 15-20 seconds each that form a complete paragraph.

Here's a sample script you can read naturally:

```
"Hello, my name is Alex, and I enjoy reading books about technology 
and science. Yesterday, I walked through the park, observing the 
beautiful autumn leaves. The weather was quite pleasant, with a 
gentle breeze and warm sunshine. I often think about how amazing 
our world is, full of interesting discoveries waiting to be made."
```

### Recording Tips

**Must Have:**
- Only one person speaking
- Steady volume throughout
- Consistent tone and emotion
- Small pauses between sentences (about half a second)

**Nice to Have:**
- No background noise
- No room echo
- Professional mic (but phone is fine too!)

**Avoid:**
- Multiple speakers in one recording
- Big changes in volume or emotion
- Background music or TV
- Rushing through without pauses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

**Voice sounds robotic?**
- Try recording for at least 15-30 seconds
- Speak more naturally and add pauses

**Voice doesn't sound like you?**
- Make sure you're the only person speaking in the recording
- Check that there's no background music or TV

**Poor audio quality?**
- Find a quieter room to record
- Move closer to your microphone
- Try using a different recording device
